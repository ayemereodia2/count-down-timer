# count-down-timer
The count down timer is a timer used to schedule future events. The user begins by entering the name of the future event ("wedding, dinner etc.) and then sets a date and a time.
The app also sends scheduled push notifications before the due date, shares data between screens and works with a realm database.

Requirements
Users enter a name for their countdown timer (e.g. “My Wedding”) and enter a date and time for when the event will take place. 
Afterwards, users can view the countdown screen for an event, showing how many days and hours are left
